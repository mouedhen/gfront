    <h1>RAJ-Tunisia </h1>
    <h2>A historical overview</h2>
    <p>Following the 2011 social and political uprising in Tunisia calling for freedoms, dignity and social justice, a
      debate on the nature and role of the state which suits the aspirations of the Tunisian people was launched.</p>
    <p>Inspired by youth dynamics, the RAJ-Tunisia organization was founded within the framework of the World Social
      Forum, held in Tunisia in 2013.</p>
    <p>RAJ-Tunisia called for a general meeting in which the organization presented its principles and objectives. The
      meeting was held in cooperation with EYES organization and contributed to the formulation of a joint, self-managed
      work at the World Social Forum to support the organization.</p>
    <p>After meeting with the international civil society youth, we decided to establish an organization that promotes
      youth-related issues, faithful to the self- organization principles and to the new structures created by youth in
      the world. An organization that empowers youth to bring about change and to develop their capacities as defenders
      of democracy.</p>
    <h2>Our PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>RAJ-Tunisia encourages youth to volunteer for the benefit of society and supports individual projects within
        the framework of social, political and / or vocational integration.
      </li>
      <li>RAJ-Tunisia was inspired by organizations of emerging youth movements in the world, especially their long-term
        view and self-management. Decisions are made at public meetings by consensus and online dissemination of
        information.
      </li>
      <li>Make youth contribute in decision-making</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Our OBJECTIVES</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Enabling youth to become active and practice their citizenship in an effective and dynamic way by encouraging
        and accompanying individual initiatives.
      </li>
      <li>Facilitating social communication by providing a space for youth to meet regardless of their differences</li>
      <li>Dissemination of citizenship values among youth and non-youth.</li>
      <li>Advocating to strengthen the role of youth in public life.</li>
      <li>Promote "co-existence" and "social cohesion" by creating alternative spaces in the reach of youth.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>RAJ -Tunisia was established by and for youth, it aims to have a leading role as a key reference in youth
      mobilization, advocacy and education through adopting innovative approaches to build a new, democratic and
      pluralist Tunisia.</p>
    <p>It also seeks to create alternative spaces for youth from different socio-economic backgrounds to help them
      contribute in building the culture of freedom and democracy in Tunisia where they can take part in public
      affairs.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>RAJ-Tunisia is a Tunisian organization whose mission is to put Tunisian youth at the center of public affairs,
      especially those who have been marginalized over the years to become disinterested and desperate due to the
      general situation in Tunisia.</p>
    <p>The approach of RAJ-Tunis differs from other organizations in seeking to resolve issues affecting not only youth
      and public policies, but also the environment and climate. This is done through advocacy campaigns, non-formal
      education, raising the awareness of about these issues and producing expertise in this field, enabling youth in
      the organization to position themselves as a true actor for change and work in this direction through alternative
      proposals.</p>
    <p>RAJ - Tunisia stands not only as a "critic / mediator" among the various groups involved in youth issues but also
      provides suggestions, education and assistance.</p>
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>Our philosophy revolves around a set of values, which we consider to be supportive of any civic activity. These
      values are <strong>tolerance, transparency, democracy, creativity, credibility, struggle, optimism and
        accuracy.</strong></p>

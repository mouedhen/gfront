    <p>The&nbsp;European Endowment for Democracy (EED) is a grant-giving organization that supports local actors of
      democratic change in the European Neighborhood and beyond.</p>
    <p> The&nbsp;European Endowment for Democracy was created to promote European democratic values and freedom. With a
      joint effort of institutions in the EU member states, (EED) remains an independent private institution with a seat
      in Brussels</p>
    <p>"The (EED) can play an important role by working directly with all those who are thirsty for democracy by
      providing flexible non-bureaucratic support and adopting measures tailored to meet their needs and demands on the
      ground" </p>
